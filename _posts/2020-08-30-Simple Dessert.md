# Bread Pudding

## Easy and quick recipe for a delicious dessert (Serves 6)

### Ingredients

* 2 cups of milk

* 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, a bit more for greasing the pan

* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

* ⅓ cup sugar

* A pinch of salt

* ½ loaf sweet egg bread like challah or brioche, cut into 2-inch cubes (about 5 to 6 cups)

* 2 eggs, beaten

### Preparation

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm milk, butter, vanilla, sugar and salt. Continue cooking just until butter melts; cool. Meanwhile, butter a 4-to-6-cup baking dish and fill it with small chunks of bread.

2. Add eggs to cooled milk mixture and whisk; pour mixture over bread. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until custard is set but still a little wobbly and edges of bread have browned. Serve warm or at room temperature.
